<h1>Abbaccio the Dog</h1>

<p>
Abbaccio the dog is another hero dog, who  has a special place in the hearts of my kids as he is the very first dog I ever had.  Being the first dog to be adopted and raising him for 5 years has been a great experience.  As a very active and enthusiastic dog I can easily go back to school when I need a treat, and as the owner's dog he spends much of his time playing with other dogs and exploring new dog areas.  My kids can't help but be amazed at the different things that the dog picks up during his day.  It never ceases to amaze me what they can pick up around here.

<h2> Naming</h2>
<p>
Abbaccio the dog is names after a character in jojo's Bizarre Adventure episode "Mimi's Pet". But it was actually given to him by an angel named Stellan (a reference to one of his attacks) and he got a few minor injuries, which made him pretty useless as a pet.
